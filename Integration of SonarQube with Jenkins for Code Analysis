Project Name: Integration of different tools with Jenkins
Project Name: Integration of SonarQube with Jenkins for Code Analysis:
1.	Configured SonarQube in the ec2 instance and started sonarqube with sonaradmin user to access the sonarqube.
2.	Integrated SonarQube with Jenkins by using the slave and master-concept.
3.	Installed all the prerequisites to the integration of sonarqube with Jenkins for code analysis.

 
 
 
 
4.	Created a demo_app project and generate the token.
 
5.	In the Global configuration added SonarQube scanner details.
6.	In Jenkins > Manage Jenkins > Configure system added sonarqube details and authenticate with token created on the sonarqube
 

 
7.	Created the New Pipe line job and added Pipeline Script.

pipeline{
	    agent any
	    environment {
	        PATH = "$PATH:/opt/apache-maven-3.8.2/bin"
	    }
	    stages{
	       stage('GetCode')
	            steps{
	                git 'https://github.com/ravdy/javaloginapp.git'
	            }
	         }        
	       stage('Build'){
	            steps{
	                sh 'mvn clean package'
	            }
	         }
	        stage('SonarQube analysis') {
	//    def scannerHome = tool 'SonarScanner 4.0';
	        steps{
	        withSonarQubeEnv('sonarqube-8.9') { 
	        // If you have configured more than one global server connection, you can specify its name
	//      sh "${scannerHome}/bin/sonar-scanner"
	        sh "mvn sonar:sonar"
	    }
	        }
	        }
	       
	    }
	}
8.	Build the code.

 
9.	Coded Build Successfully.

 

10.	Went to Sonarqube and checked demoapp_project and checked the code analysis.
 
11.	Code analysis got successfully.
